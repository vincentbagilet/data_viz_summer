## Course objectives and overview

A significant portion of communicating economic research results-whether in presentations or written papersâ€”relies on graphs and visuals. This session aims to **help you develop essential skills for effective data visualization**. We will cover fundamental visualization principles and general **best practices** before examining the specific challenges of data visualization for **causal inference**. While it can be a powerful rhetorical tool for causal inference, data visualizations can also be misleading if not handled carefully.

## Useful handbooks

### Data Viz

Here is a short list of useful applied data visualization handbooks:

-   [Fundamentals of Data Visualization](https://clauswilke.com/dataviz/) provides a great code-free introduction to data viz.^[Although R code can be found on [the book's GitHub](https://github.com/clauswilke/dataviz) if needed.]
-   [Modern Data Visualization with R](https://rkabacoff.github.io/datavis/index.html) and [Data Visualization - A practical introduction](https://socviz.co/index.html) both discuss key data viz concepts and teaches you how to apply them in R and ggplot.
-   [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/) provides a nice introduction to [ggplot](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/), THE package to build plots in R. To go further you can read [this book](https://ggplot2-book.org/).

### Resources for implementation (in R)

R is a super useful tools for applied economics analysis (and way beyond that). Thanks to the [ggplot package](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/), it is also one of the best tools out there to make graphs in this field. If you do not know R, I would only encourage you to learn and use it. To do so, here is a list of useful resources:

-   [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/): definitely the **best** resource to learn R and the [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/) by yourself.
-   [R cheatsheets](https://posit.co/resources/cheatsheets/): great summaries of the functions in key tidyverse packages.
-   [The tidyverse style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/index.html): a very short book to help you write more legible R code.
-   [Tidy design principles](https://design.tidyverse.org/) a more advanced book to help you write better R code. <!-- - Any book by [Hadley Wickham](https://hadley.nz/) or the [Posit](https://posit.co/) team is a good place to start.  -->
