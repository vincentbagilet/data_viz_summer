A significant portion of communicating economic research results-whether in presentations or written papersâ€”relies on graphs and visuals. This session aims to **help you develop essential skills for effective data visualization**. We will cover fundamental visualization principles and general **best practices** before examining the specific challenges of data visualization for **causal inference**. While it can be a powerful rhetorical tool for causal inference, data visualizations can also be misleading if not handled carefully.
