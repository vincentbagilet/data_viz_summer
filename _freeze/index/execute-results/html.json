Please install it before class. You can find instructions for installation [here](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/intro#prerequisites).\n\nYou are also expected to have a previous knowledge of R and of the Tidyverse. If you do not, the book [**R for Data Science**](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/) is definitely the **best** resource to learn R and the [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/). Read it cover to cover, running all the code in the book yourself; by the time you finish the book, you will know R!\n:::\n",
