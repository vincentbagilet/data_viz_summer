How can we detect them?\"\npublished-title: \"Date\"\ndate: \"2024-09-11\"\nself-contained: true\nengine: knitr\n---\n\n\n::: callout-tip\n## Objective\n\nAfter this session, you should have some ideas about how to avoid some pitfalls in applied economic studies and be able to set up the foundations to implement a basic simulation for regression analysis in R.\n:::\n\n## Summary\n\nIn this session, we first discuss the **logistics** of the class and present the **capabilities of `R`**. It is a great language, learn it and make nice things with it! Then, we present some **pitfalls** that we can encounter in applied research: spurious correlation, reverse causality, confounders, model misspecification, external validity, lack of statistical power. We then discuss **how to avoid them**: you can learn your econometrics, derive maths the maths or what might be more fun, develop some data visualization and run some simulations. Finally we describe **how to generate fake data**, postulating a DGP and run a simple simulation.\n\n### Session Outline\n\n1.  Introduction, course overview and logistics\n1.  R: why and how?\n1.

We emulate an RCT studying the impact of additional courses on students' grades.\n\nYou can find the document for this exercise [here](sim/sim_1_school_lessons.qmd).\n\n## Specific resources for this lecture\n\n- A fun website with examples of spurious correlations: [https://tylervigen.com/](https://tylervigen.com/)\n- An introduction to Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs): [Chapter 3 of *Causal Inference, The Mixtape*](https://mixtape.scunning.com/03-directed_acyclical_graphs)\n",
