Here we discuss to what extent it also matters beyond identification.\"\npublished-title: \"Date\"\ndate: \"2024-10-09\"\nself-contained: true\nengine: knitr\n---\n\n\n::: callout-tip\n## Objective\n\nThis session aims to underline the importance of design, beyond identification, and how it is affected by the fact that empirical studies often pursue multiple goals.\n:::\n\n## Summary\n\nCausal inference studies generally have multiple goals, aiming not only to estimate ``the'' average treatment effect but also analyze how it **varies across individuals and time, how it impacts multiple outcomes, or how these effects can be extrapolated to other populations**. Expecting to produce these multiple estimates, combined with the importance of external validity, can orient choices at the design stage, to ensure the study is set up for success.\n\nTo address this, one can make substantively-motivated assumptions about effect sizes and variation in light of the goals of a study, anticipating and allowing for both uncertainty and heterogeneity in effect sizes. \n\n### Session Outline\n\n1.
