However, it is very likely that the actual DGP would be different from the one we modeled. For instance, effects are very likely heterogenous across individuals. \n\n::: callout-note\nWe are often interested in estimating a version of an ATE (Average Treatment Effect). The wording itself (\"average\") implies that effects are heterogenous across individuals.\n:::\n\nIn this exercise, you will implement the same power analysis as the one we implemented before but with some sort of heterogeneity in treatment effects.\n\n::: {.callout-caution icon=false}\n\n## Question 1\n\nList other reasons than heterogeneity in treatment effect for the DGP to be different from the one we simulated so far.\n:::\n\nAlthough there are other reasons for the DGP to be different, we will \nIn order to add heterogeneity to the analysis, we need to modify <input class='webex-solveme nospaces' size='13' data-answer='[\"generate_data\"]'/>. \n\n::: {.callout-caution icon=false}\n\n## Question 2\n\nModify what is needed and run the same simulation as before.
