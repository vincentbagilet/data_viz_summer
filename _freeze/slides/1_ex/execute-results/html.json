Course logistics\n2.  Why do accurate estimates matters?\n3.  Why are simulations useful?\n4.  The overall approach to simulations\n5.  Implementation in R\n\n## Exercise\n\n*This section will describe the exercise that we will do in class and provide links to the data sets and tools used.*\n\nSince the TDs have not yet started, we will use Google Collabs to run today's code online. In the future, you will use R Studio.\n\n## Additional Resources\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nN <- 15\n```\n:::\n",
